# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Recursion is well-suited for the following types of problems:

    Tree Traversal: Breaking down each tree node into smaller sub-units, perfect for recursion.
    Divide-and-Conquer: Problems like binary search, where you repeatedly break an array in half.
    Dynamic Programming: Solving overlapping sub-problems efficiently, such as in the Fibonacci sequence.
Recursion simplifies code by naturally handling problems with repetitive sub-problem structures.
