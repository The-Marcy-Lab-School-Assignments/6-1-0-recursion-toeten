# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Problems that can be solved iteratively can usually also be solved using recursion.

# Teacher Feedback
While it's true that many problems that can be solved iteratively can also be solved using recursion, the question specifically asks about the types of problems that are best solved using recursion. 

Additionally, you can provide more insight into why recursion is advantageous in certain types of problems, such as problems involving tree traversal, dynamic programming, or divide-and-conquer strategies.
