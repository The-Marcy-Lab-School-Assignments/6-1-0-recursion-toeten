# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Recursion is well-suited for the following types of problems:

    Tree Traversal: Breaking down each tree node into smaller sub-units, perfect for recursion.
    Divide-and-Conquer: Problems like binary search, where you repeatedly break an array in half.
    Dynamic Programming: Solving overlapping sub-problems efficiently, such as in the Fibonacci sequence.
Recursion simplifies code by naturally handling problems with repetitive sub-problem structures.

# Teacher Feedback
While it's true that many problems that can be solved iteratively can also be solved using recursion, the question specifically asks about the types of problems that are best solved using recursion. 

Additionally, you can provide more insight into why recursion is advantageous in certain types of problems, such as problems involving tree traversal, dynamic programming, or divide-and-conquer strategies.
