# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive fuction is a function that calls itself. The cases that exist in a recursive function are:
The base case - the case where we end our function.
The recursive case - the function continues to call itself with modified parameters, gradually approaching the base case.
